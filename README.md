# kagebot – where the code is better than the name
This bot is a replacement for [my old one](https://git.kageru.moe/kageru/discord-selphybot) with a very simple premise:
As much as possible should be configurable in a human-readable way.
This will allow anyone to modify the config to host their own instance tailored to their own needs,
and it allows server moderators to make changes without any coding experience. Even at runtime.
I try to maintain a comprehensive default configuration as part of the repository
because the past has taught me that I’m not good at updating readmes.
